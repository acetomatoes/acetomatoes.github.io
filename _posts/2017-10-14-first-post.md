Hello. Welcome to the relaunch of **ACETOMATOES**. I regrettably let the old site lapse and have been meaning to get it back up and running for some time now. So here we are, new look and platform. Great as it was I decided to ditch (i.e.,not pay for) Squarespace and just host everything on [Github](https://github.com). I like the control, flexibility, and transparency of it all. 

#### New Format
I'm also going to change up the format a bit here. The primary focus of the site will still be open data projects but I'm also planning to share some other types of content. One will be simply sharing more of the code I write for the various projects. This includes the creation and sharing of the code behind some Shiny apps (R framework for building web apps) that I'm working on. 

#### The Nerdery
In addition, I'm also planning to make this more of a *general nerdery* and posting about topics not directly related to open data and coding. Those who know me and visited the bars I used to work at are familiar with my enthusiasm for creating cocktails. I still find it to be a nice creative outlet so I'm planning to share new, and maybe some classic, recipes and things of that nature.

#### Guests
Finally, also thinking about having some guest posts from time to time. I've had the good fortune to meet and befriend some incredibly smart and talented people and I hope to showcase some of their work.

So, off we go.Thanks for stopping by to check out the site. Feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, or even any open data project ideas.
